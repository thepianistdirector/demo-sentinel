# Plan: Demo Sentinel Platform

PLAN_STATUS: APPROVED

## Goal

Build a demo platform that replicates the Microsoft Sentinel interface for MSSP sales demos where clients interact hands-on with a realistic Sentinel experience using pre-loaded data sets from CSV files.

## Non-Goals

- Real Azure integration (no actual Log Analytics workspace)
- Real playbook execution (visual only)
- Mobile-optimized UI (tablet passable is sufficient)
- Multi-language support

## Assumptions

- CSV data will be provided by the user in the expected format
- Azure subscription is available for deployment
- Basic familiarity with React/TypeScript for maintenance

## Architecture Impact

New standalone application with:
- React + TypeScript + Fluent UI frontend
- Azure Functions Node.js API
- Cosmos DB for data storage
- Blob Storage for CSV files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: UI Fidelity - Side-by-side with real Sentinel, indistinguishable at first glance
- [ ] AC2: KQL Works - Run `SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4625 | summarize count() by Account | top 10 by count_` and get correct results
- [ ] AC3: Data Isolation - Client A cannot see Client B's data under any circumstance
- [ ] AC4: Full Navigation - All Sentinel sections accessible and populated with data
- [ ] AC5: Data Set Switching - Admin can assign different data sets to different clients
- [ ] AC6: Performance - Queries return in <2 seconds for 100k row tables
- [ ] AC7: Mobile Passable - Readable on tablet (not optimized, but functional)

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
- [ ] Set up Fluent UI v9
- [ ] Create basic app shell with Sentinel layout
- [ ] Set up Azure Functions project
- [ ] Configure local development environment

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- [ ] Build navigation sidebar with all Sentinel sections
- [ ] Implement Azure portal header
- [ ] Create data grid component (Fluent UI DetailsList)
- [ ] Build detail panel component
- [ ] Implement Sentinel dark theme styling

### Phase 3: Authentication
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Implement JWT auth in Azure Functions
- [ ] Build admin panel for user management
- [ ] Implement role-based access (Admin vs Client)

### Phase 4: Data Management
- [ ] Design Cosmos DB schema
- [ ] Build CSV upload and processing pipeline
- [ ] Implement data set management (create, assign, delete)
- [ ] Create sample data sets for testing

### Phase 5: KQL Engine
- [ ] Build KQL parser (using PEG.js or Chevrotain)
- [ ] Implement core operators (where, project, summarize, etc.)
- [ ] Build query executor against in-memory data
- [ ] Add pre-canned queries feature
- [ ] Implement query history

### Phase 6: Sentinel Pages
- [ ] Overview dashboard with charts and tiles
- [ ] Incidents page with list and detail views
- [ ] Logs page with KQL editor (Monaco)
- [ ] Data Connectors page
- [ ] Analytics rules page
- [ ] Workbooks page (read-only templates)
- [ ] Hunting page
- [ ] Entity Behavior (UEBA) pages
- [ ] Threat Intelligence page
- [ ] Automation/Playbooks page (visual only)
- [ ] Content Hub page
- [ ] Settings page

### Phase 7: Infrastructure
- [ ] Create Bicep templates for Azure resources
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] Configure production deployment
- [ ] Set up Application Insights monitoring

### Phase 8: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Screenshot comparison with real Sentinel
- [ ] Performance testing with large data sets
- [ ] Security review (auth, data isolation)
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## Delegation Brief Requirements

Each delegation must:
- Produce working code with no stubs or placeholders
- Include unit tests where applicable
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Run linter and fix any issues

## Verification Plan

- Visual comparison with real Sentinel screenshots
- KQL query execution tests
- Auth and data isolation penetration testing
- Performance benchmarks with 100k+ rows

## Rollback Plan

- Git-based rollback to previous working state
- Azure deployment slots for zero-downtime rollback

## Risks / Unknowns

- KQL parser complexity may require iterative development
- Sentinel UI may change, requiring updates
- Large CSV files may need chunked processing
