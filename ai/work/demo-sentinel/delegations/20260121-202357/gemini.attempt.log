I will start by reading the existing frontend code to understand the project structure and dependencies, specifically `App.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and `package.json`.
I will now create the mock authentication service `frontend/src/services/authService.ts` and the authentication context `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to handle user state and login/logout functionality.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "add_issue_comment", "get_commit", "list_commits"?
I will invoke the `cli_help` agent to inquire about the available methods for creating and writing to files, as the standard `write_file` and `run_shell_command` tools appear to be missing from my current toolset.
Error executing tool delegate_to_agent: Tool execution denied by policy.
