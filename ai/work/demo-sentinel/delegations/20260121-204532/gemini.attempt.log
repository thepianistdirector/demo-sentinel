I will read `frontend/src/pages/Overview.tsx` and `frontend/package.json` to understand the current implementation and project configuration.
I will update `frontend/src/pages/Overview.tsx` to include the `Spinner` component, managing the loading state with `useState` and `useEffect`. I'll also add a `loadingContainer` style to center the spinner.
I will verify the changes by running the build command.
I have completed the task. I added a loading state to the Overview page, including a spinner that displays for 1 second before showing the content. The build was successful.

Summary of changes:
1.  Modified `frontend/src/pages/Overview.tsx`:
    *   Imported `Spinner` from `@fluentui/react-components`.
    *   Imported `useState` and `useEffect` from `react`.
    *   Added `isLoading` state initialized to `true`.
    *   Added a `useEffect` hook to simulate data fetching with a 1-second delay.
    *   Added conditional rendering to show the `Spinner` when `isLoading` is true.
    *   Added `loadingContainer` style to center the spinner.

Build Verification:
*   Ran `pnpm build` in `frontend/` directory.
*   Build completed successfully.
