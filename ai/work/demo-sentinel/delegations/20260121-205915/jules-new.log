Task: # Delegation Brief: Phase 7 - Infrastructure

## Summary

Set up development and deployment infrastructure for the demo-sentinel platform. This includes Docker containerization for local development, environment configuration, and basic deployment setup.

## Goal

Enable easy local development and prepare the application for deployment to Azure Static Web Apps or similar hosting.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Docker Development Setup**
   - Dockerfile for building the frontend
   - docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Hot reload working in Docker

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - .env.example with documented variables
   - Environment-based API URL configuration
   - Production vs development build modes

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Vite build configuration for production
   - Code splitting setup
   - Asset optimization

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Static site build output in dist/
   - SPA routing configuration (redirects for client-side routing)
   - Documentation for deployment options

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for frontend
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment
- `.dockerignore` - Exclude unnecessary files from Docker context
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `nginx.conf` - Production serving configuration (for Docker)
- `staticwebapp.config.json` - Azure Static Web Apps config (optional)

### Modify Files
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Add build optimizations
- `frontend/package.json` - Add Docker-related scripts if needed

## Technical Constraints

- Keep the setup simple - this is a demo app
- Support both Docker and non-Docker development
- Frontend-only deployment (no backend API needed for demo)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t demo-sentinel .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Verify frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

# Production build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Verify dist/ directory created with all assets
ls -la frontend/dist/
```

## Notes

- The app is frontend-only with mock data
- No backend API or database required
- Authentication is simulated (localStorage)
- Focus on making it easy to demo locally
